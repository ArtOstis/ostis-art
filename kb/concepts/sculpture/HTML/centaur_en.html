<h1>The Battle of the Centaurs</h1>

The Battle of the Centaurs (Italian. Battaglia dei centauri; also - “The Battle of Hercules with the Centaurs”) is a marble relief with a scene of the centauromy created by Michelangelo in about 1492. This bas-relief refers to his first known independent works (as well as the Madonna on the Staircase), and in him he found himself as a sculptor. Vasari describes him as a work done “so beautifully that one who now looks at her cannot believe that this is the work of a young man, and not a respected master, who is perfect in the science and practice of art.”
According to Eric Shiliano, in this bas-relief, the young sculptor "embodied the commandments of the Greeks and Romans." It is also the first known work that can be considered a “non-finito”.
