Giambologna, Giovanni da Bologna (Giambologna, Giovanni da Bologna), real name Jean de Boulogne (Jean de Boulogne) (1529, Douai, now France - August 13, 1608, Florence) - Florentine sculptor-mannerist and representative of the early Baroque.
Dzhambolonya was strongly influenced by Michelangelo (under whose leadership he worked for about two years in Rome), however, he created his own artistic style of the Mannerist style, distinguished by elegant surfaces, cold elegance and beauty.
Giambologna received the first large fee from Pope Pius IV for the giant bronze statue of Neptune for the Fountain of Neptune in Bologna. Giambologna created numerous sculptures of marble and bronze, including for the decoration of fountains, for Italian nobility and especially for the Medici. Most of his life spent in Florence, where he moved in 1553
