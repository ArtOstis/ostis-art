<h1>Citizens of Kale</h1>

Citizens of Kale - a sculpture by French sculptor Auguste Rodin, dedicated to one of the episodes of the Hundred Years War. The idea to perpetuate the memory of outstanding countrymen was discussed in Calais from the middle of the XIX century. This monument was supposed to express the emotions overwhelming the French - and the bitterness of defeat, and the rapture of the heroic sacrifice of fellow citizens.
