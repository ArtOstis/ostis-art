<h1>Neptune Fountain</h1>
Neptune Fountain is one of the main attractions of the historic center of Bologna, located opposite the entrance to the Palace of Palazzo Re Enzo. It was built on the eponymous square in 1567 on the site of residential buildings, which on this occasion were demolished. The author of the figure of Neptune was the famous sculptor Dzhambolonya, who took as a model a similar fountain in Florence, bearing the same name - Neptune Fountain. Another name for the Bologna fountain is “Giant”, because its height is 3.2 meters and its weight reaches 2.2 tons.
