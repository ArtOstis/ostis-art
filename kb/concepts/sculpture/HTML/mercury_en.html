<h1>Mercury</h1>

“Mercury” is a bronze sculpture of Florentine sculptor Giambologi, a classic example of Mannerist sculpture, a recognized masterpiece by this master. << ... in bronze, he made a colossal and completely round statue of Bacchus, as well as Mercury in flight, very ingeniously conceived, since he rests entirely on the tips of the toes of one leg, sent to Emperor Maximilian as an undoubtedly rare thing. ">> so spoke about this sculpture Vasari.
