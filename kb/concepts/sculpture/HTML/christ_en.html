<h1>Lamentation of Christ</h1>

"Lamentation of Christ" - the first and most outstanding drink created by Michelangelo Buonarroti. This is the only work of the sculptor, which he signed (according to Vasari, having overheard conversation of onlookers, who argued about its authorship). Copies of "Pieta" can be seen in many Catholic churches around the world, from Mexico to Korea.
