<h1>Apollo and Daphne</h1>
"Apollo and Daphne" (Italian. Apollo e Dafne) is a Baroque marble sculpture by the Italian master Bernini, made between 1622-1625, in the Borghese Gallery in Rome. The plot is based on one of the stories included in Ovid's Metamorphosis.
The sculptor captured the result of the mythological chase Apollo, the sun god, behind the beautiful nymph Daphne. Daphne, caught up with Apollo, asks for help from the gods - and begins to turn into a laurel. We see the heroes at the very moment when Apollo almost overtook the fugitive, but Daphne's fingers are already turning into branches, and her legs are turning into the roots of laurel.
