<h1>statue of John the Prophet</h1>

The marble statue of John the Prophet in the Bargello Museum represents the Forerunner in the form of a thin man, whose face expresses the unstoppable work of thought. Absorbed in reflections, he goes forward, not knowing where, trusting in providence; his half-open mouths are ready to utter prophetic words.
