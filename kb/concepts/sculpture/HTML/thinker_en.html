<h1>The Thinker</h1>

The Thinker (fr. Le Penseur) is one of the most famous sculptural works of Auguste Rodin. The master worked on it in the years 1880-1882. The original sculpture is exhibited at the Rodin Museum in Paris. According to the author’s original design, the sculpture was called “The Poet” and was part of the Gates of Hell composition based on the Divine Comedy, depicting Dante, the creator of the paintings of hell cast in bronze. Rodin’s design was complicated by the time. In particular, the image of Dante was replaced by the universal image of the creator.
