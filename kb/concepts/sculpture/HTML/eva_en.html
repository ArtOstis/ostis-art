<h1>Eve</h1>

The fragile and defenseless figure of "Eve" was intended for the ensemble "Gates of Hell." As conceived by the author, she had to, together with the figure of “Adam,” flank the gate doors. Rodin managed with amazing skill to betray the bashful confusion and despair that seized his heroine. This sculpture was purchased in Paris by MA. Morozov, the elder brother of a famous collector.
