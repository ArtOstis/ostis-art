<h1>Guttelamata statue</h1>
For ten years Italian sculptor Donatello worked on the prototype of all subsequent equestrian statues of Europe. By 1453, the master had built a magnificent monument to condottier Gattamelate from bronze: a composition more than three meters long rises on an eight-meter pedestal.
Venetian mercenary commander deserved popular fame thanks to such qualities as courage and deceit. His figure sits on a horse majestically and nobly, with the determination and steadfastness inherent in military leaders.
