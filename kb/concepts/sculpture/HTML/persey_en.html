<h1>Perseus with the head of Medusa</h1>

Created by Antonio Canova between 1800 and 1801. and acquired by Pius VII the next year (for 3000 guilds) along with two other statues. Canova portrayed the triumphant Perseus at the moment when he cut off the head of the Gorgon Medusa with the sickle received from Athena. Canova's ice classicism is superior even in such a bloody scene as this one, where the Argive hero holds the head of Medusa with a wide and calm gesture of restrained victory, whose face, posthumously stiff, has only slightly twisted in pain.
