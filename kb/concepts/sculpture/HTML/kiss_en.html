<h1>The Kiss</h1>

“Kiss” is a marble sculpture created by Auguste Rodin and presented in 1889 at the World Exhibition in Paris. Originally depicted, the embracing couple was part of a relief group adorning the large bronze sculpted gate “Gates of Hell,” commissioned by Rodin for the future art museum in Paris. Later it was removed from there and replaced by a sculpture of another pair of lovers, located on the small right column.
