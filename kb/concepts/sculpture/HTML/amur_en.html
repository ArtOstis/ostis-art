<h1>Cupid and Psyche</h1>


“Cupid and Psyche” is a work of Venetian sculptor Antonio Canova, made of marble in two versions by order made in Naples in 1787 by Scottish collector and connoisseur of art Baron Caudor. The plot is taken from the work of the ancient Roman writer Apuleius "Metamorphosis, or the Golden Donkey".
